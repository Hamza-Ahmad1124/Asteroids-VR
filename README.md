A modern adaption of the classic Asteroids game, made in 3D and VR supported.The game is made in a 3D environment using unity, which tests the user’s brain reflexes and ensures an everlasting VR experience. The intention is to create a VR based space environment with some obstacles to shoot.

4.	Along the way, I was also learning more about Unity Editor and Scripting to make the game more real time like and better.

5.	In the Beginning some functionalities were created strictly through basic coding technique and as I learnt more about Unity and its API’s, I began to realize that much functionalities that I implemented aggressively can be achieved easily using Unity’s API’s.
